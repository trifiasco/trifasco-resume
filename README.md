# trifiasco-resume

This is a `CLI` version of my resume. This was created as an alternative to the traditional resume. Yes, I have a lot of time to spare :P 

Well, the license is `MIT`, but the informations are solely mine.

# Install

This package is available in [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trifiasco-resume). To install from the command line use - 

```
npm i trifiasco-resume
``` 

Or to install it globally (which I recommend) - 

```
npm install --global trifiasco-resume
```

Note - If you are a ubuntu user, and you don't have proper permission settings, then you may get `EACCESS ERROR`. Just append `sudo` before the command and you will be set.

If you installed it globally, then run the following command in the terminal - 
```
trifiasco-resume
```
If you used the first command, then go to the `node_modules` folder, where the package was installed and then from the terminal run 
```
node trifiasco-resume
```
